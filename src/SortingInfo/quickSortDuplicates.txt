Pseudo Code:
1. Choose a pivot element from the array.
2. Partition the array into three subarrays: elements less than the pivot, elements equal to the pivot, and elements greater than the pivot.
3. Recursively apply the same process to the subarrays.
4. Combine the subarrays to get the sorted array.
