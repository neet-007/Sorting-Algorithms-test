Pseudo Code:
1. Choose a pivot element from the array.
2. Partition the array into two subarrays: elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot.
3. Recursively apply the same process to the subarrays.
4. Combine the subarrays to get the sorted array.

Information:
Memory: O(log n)
Time: O(n log n) on average, O(n^2) worst case
Type: Comparison-based, Divide-and-Conquer
Best Use Case: Large arrays or when average performance is more important than worst-case performance.
