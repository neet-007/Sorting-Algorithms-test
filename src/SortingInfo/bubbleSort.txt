Pseudo Code:
1. Iterate through the array.
2. Compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order.
3. Repeat the process for each element until the array is sorted.
4. The largest element "bubbles" to the end of the array on each pass.

Time: O(n^2)
Type: Comparison-based
Best Use Case: Small arrays or when the array is nearly sorted.
